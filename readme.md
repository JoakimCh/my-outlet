[Visit the actual website here.](https://joakimch.github.io/my-outlet/) Or keep reading to know more about what's "behind the scenes"...

## Description

This is the source code for the website where I publish some of my writings. And the website itself is going to be a demo of my own "blogging" software that I write from scratch.

### Blogging software you say?

Yup. As in an easy way to share articles to a website and browse them easily while on that website. Without: Lots of bloat, a terrible user interface making it painful to find the content and unnecessarily complicated code.

#### So does it have its own repository?

Well, as I'm "prototyping" it here this is currently its repository. When I'm pleased with this prototype I might create a dedicated repository for this software and prepare it for a broader use by anyone who's interested.
